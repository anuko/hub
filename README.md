# Anuko Hub
This is work in progress.

Our hubmle attempt to design an open source message hub
to communicate with other hubs with some redundancy.

This is a companion product for other projects such as
anuko/auctionserver, anuko/doitserver, possibly others.

A hub is used to connect a standalone server to a network
of such servers to increase their exposure to users.

Currently, nothing is complete, starting to work on it...
